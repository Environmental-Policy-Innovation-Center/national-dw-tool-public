Description of the datasets included in this bulk national download: 

 - epa_sabs.geojson - EPA's Community Water System Service Area Boundaries. It 
      possible to merge this dataset to others in this zipped folder using the
      "pwsid" field 

 - pwsid-water-socio-df.csv - summary water system information and socioeconomic
      characteristics of the population served by the water system. 
      
 - pwsid-enviro-df.csv - summary environmental characteristics of the watershed 
      systems are pulling from. Please note that a single water system may be 
      pulling water from multiple subwatersheds (HUC12), so a single water system 
      may appear multiple times in this dataset.
